## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document that functions as a "How to" for Cost Distance Analysis in R. 

-File paths will need to altered to fit the users' set up*
-Large file data sets such as the "Decha_Transect_points"" should be .gitignored so they do not exist on the github repository as they are large files.

-Packages may need to be downloaded prior to running script. (raster, sp, igraph,)

#Load neccesary packages
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(gdistance)

```



```{r}

```
